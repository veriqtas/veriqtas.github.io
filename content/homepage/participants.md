{{< abstract "Click to view Abstract" >}}
Fully characterizing large-scale quantum systems in practice requires exponentially increasing resources, but focusing on application-relevant information can often lead to significantly more efficient protocols. Overlapping tomography is such a scheme, allowing one to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems of multiparticle quantum systems in an efficient manner. In this talk I will present protocols for overlapping tomography of qudits and of fermionic simulators that are optimal with respect to the number of measurement settings. The construction of these protocols is connected to the problems of graph clique covering and of covering arrays in combinatorics, for which solutions based on binary programming are given. The practical relevance of the protocols found by solving these programs is demonstrated by a six-photon experiment where all two-body marginals of a Dicke state are reconstructed with significantly reduced measurement time in comparison to previous approaches.
