{{< abstract "From Bell's theorem to the device-independent quantum information scenario" >}}
Bell’s theorem proved the existence of quantum correlations with no classical analogue. After reviewing this fundamental result, we show how Bell non-local correlations are the crucial ingredient for device-independent quantum information applications. In this paradigm, devices are seen as uncharacterised quantum black boxes processing classical information and protocols are built without requiring any device modelling. This device-independent property guarantees that the protocol performance is self-certified and, in particular, provides the strongest form of quantum security. We conclude by discussing applications of the device-independent formalism in other fields, such as quantum foundations or many-body physics.
This talk will be a [colloquium](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/seminars/colloquium/2026-03-23).

{{< abstract "Local Certification of Many-Body Steady States" >}}
We present a relaxation-based method to determine expectation values on the steady state of dissipative many-body quantum systems described by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of targeting to represent the entire state, we promote the reduced density matrices to our variables and enforce the constraints that are imposed on them by consistency with a global steady state. The resulting constraints have the form of a semidefinite program, which allows us to efficiently bound the values a given expectation value can take in the steady state. Our results show fast convergence of the bounds with the size of the reduced density matrices, giving very competitive predictions for the steady state of several one- and two-dimensional models.

{{< abstract "Optimal overlapping tomography of qudits and fermionic simulators" >}}
Fully characterizing large-scale quantum systems in practice requires exponentially increasing resources, but focusing on application-relevant information can often lead to significantly more efficient protocols. Overlapping tomography is such a scheme, allowing one to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems of multiparticle quantum systems in an efficient manner. In this talk I will present protocols for overlapping tomography of qudits and of fermionic simulators that are optimal with respect to the number of measurement settings. The construction of these protocols is connected to the problems of graph clique covering and of covering arrays in combinatorics, for which solutions based on binary programming are given. The practical relevance of the protocols found by solving these programs is demonstrated by a six-photon experiment where all two-body marginals of a Dicke state are reconstructed with significantly reduced measurement time in comparison to previous approaches.
This talk is based on [arXiv:2408.05730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05730) and [arXiv:2512.11726](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11726).

{{< abstract "Full nonlocality of partially entangled states" >}}
Full nonlocality is the strongest form of nonlocality, in which every single realization of an experiment cannot be obtained with via local correlations, while in the standard nonlocality, it is the whole statistics that cannot be reproduced classically. Despite several examples of fully nonlocal correlations are present in literature, achieving it with less and less resources, it is still unclear whether full nonlocality can be obtain without having maximally entangled states.
In our work, we were able to show that it is possible to construct examples of fully nonlocal states which are partially entangled. We prove that fully nonlocal partially entangled states in all dimensions $d\ge 3$, while in dimenions $2$ we prove that such states do not exists even with respect to POVM (generalizing a previously known results).

{{< abstract "Semi-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Secure under Information and Distrust Assumptions" >}}
Bridging the gap between practical implementation and rigorous security, semi-device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a compelling middle ground—requiring minimal trust assumptions while achieving key rates competitive with fully characterized protocols. We investigate two conceptually distinct constraints on the preparation device: the information constraint and restricted distrust. We identify protocols that remain secure under both assumptions and demonstrate their robustness to experimental noise. Notably, the widely used BB84 and B92 protocols fail to provide security under the information constraint. To obtain secure key rates, we showcase a numerical framework combining tracial non-commutative polynomial optimization with entropy relaxation techniques. Our approach extends naturally to broader classes of preparation constraints and QKD protocols.

{{< abstract "A dual perspective on spectral reconstruction from ground-state correlators" >}}
Convex optimization methods are increasingly used in quantum many-body physics to extract nonperturbative information consistent with general physical constraints such as unitarity. In relativistic quantum field theory, this implies positivity of the spectral density, which encodes the dynamics of the theory and is related to imaginary-time (static, Euclidean) correlation functions via the Källén–Lehmann representation. 
Reconstructing the spectral density from these Euclidean correlation functions is an ill-posed inverse problem, which can be formulated as a linear program under positivity constraints, as recently proposed in [arXiv:2408.11766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11766). In its original formulation, however, the optimization variable is a continuous function, requiring discretization for numerical implementation and preventing fully rigorous results. Here we present a dual formulation of this spectral reconstruction problem. This eliminates the need for any discretization of the spectral density function and yields a rigorous framework for characterizing physically admissible spectra. The dual formulation allows for computer-assisted certification of spectral bounds and provides a principled way to assess whether given Euclidean correlators are compatible with a physical quantum field theory. As an application, we show that relativistic continuous matrix product states do not admit a local relativistic parent Hamiltonian, in the sense that no Hamiltonian consistent with relativistic spectral constraints can reproduce its correlators.

{{< abstract "Certified bounds on optimization problems in quantum theory" >}}
Semidefinite relaxations of polynomial optimization have become a central tool for addressing the non-convex optimization problems over non-commutative operators that are ubiquitous in quantum information theory and, more in general, quantum physics. Yet, as these global relaxation methods rely on floating-point methods, the bounds issued by the semidefinite solver can - and often do - exceed the global optimum, undermining their certifiability. To counter this issue, we introduce a rigorous framework for extracting exact rational bounds on non-commutative optimization problems from numerical data, and apply it to several paradigmatic problems in quantum information theory. An extension to sparsity and symmetry-adapted semidefinite relaxations is also provided and compared to the general dense scheme. Our results establish rational post-processing as a practical route to reliable certification, pushing semidefinite optimization toward a certifiable standard for quantum information science.

{{< abstract "Tight and self-testing multipartite quantum Bell inequalities from the renormalization group" >}}
 In past work, the concept of connectors was introduced: directed tensors with the property that any contraction thereof defines a multipartite quantum Bell inequality, i.e., a linear restriction on measurement probabilities that holds in any multipartite quantum experiment. In this paper we propose the notion of ''tight connectors'', which, if contracted according to some simple rules, result in tight quantum Bell inequalities. By construction, the new inequalities are saturated by tensor network states, whose structure mimics the corresponding network of connectors. Some tight connectors are furthermore ''fully self-testing'', which implies that the quantum Bell inequalities they generate can only be maximized with such a tensor network state and specific measurement operators (modulo local isometries). We provide large analytic families of tight, fully self-testing connectors that generate N-partite quantum Bell inequalities of correlator form for which the ratio between the maximum quantum and classical values increases exponentially with N.

{{< abstract "Extracting quantum field theory dynamics from an approximate ground state" >}}
 We develop a linear-programming method to extract dynamical information from static ground-state correlators in quantum field theory. We recast the Källén-Lehmann inversion as a convex optimization problem, in a spirit similar to the recent approach of Lawrence [arXiv:2408.11766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11766). This produces robust estimates of the smeared spectral density, the real-time propagator, and the mass gap directly from an approximate equal-time two-point function, and simultaneously yields an \emph{a posteriori} lower bound on the correlation-function error. We test the method on the 1+1-dimensional ϕ4 model, using a variational approximation to the vacuum -- relativistic continuous matrix product states -- that provides accurate correlators in the continuum and thermodynamic limits. The resulting mass gaps agree with renormalized Hamiltonian truncation and Borel-resummed perturbation theory across a wide range of couplings, demonstrating that accurate dynamical data can be recovered from a single equal-time slice.

{{< abstract "Genuine Multipartite Entanglement is Not Necessary for Standard Device-Independent Conference Key Agreement" >}}
Conference key agreement aims to establish shared, private randomness among many separated parties in a network. Device-independent conference key agreement (DICKA) is a variant in which the source and the measurement devices used by each party need not be trusted. So far, DICKA protocols largely fall into two categories: those that rely on violating a joint Bell inequality using genuinely multipartite entangled states and those that concatenate many bipartite protocols. The question of whether a hybrid protocol exists, where a multipartite Bell inequality can be violated using only bipartite entanglement, was asked by Grasselli et al. [Quantum 7, 980 (2023)]. We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing an asymptotically secure DICKA protocol achieving the same rate as the concatenation of bipartite device-independent quantum key distribution, yet relying on a single joint Bell violation. Our results prompt further discussion on the benefits of multipartite entanglement for DICKA over its bipartite alternative, and we give an overview of different arguments for near-term devices.

{{< abstract "An operator-algebraic formulation of robust self-testing" >}}
In this talk, I will introduce an operator-algebraic formulation of robust self-testing in terms of states on C\*-algebras. For synchronous games and similar nonlocal games, self-testing can be studied through tracial states on the associated game algebras. For these nonlocal games, I will show how the stability of the tracial states determines the robustness of a self-test. I will also discuss self-testing in parallel.
